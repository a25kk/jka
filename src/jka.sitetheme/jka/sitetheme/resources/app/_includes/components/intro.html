            <h2>What is the Jeremy Krauss Approach (JKA)?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="internal-link">The JKA is a <strong>unique way</strong> of understanding early development and helping</span><span class="internal-link"> special needs children learn, grow and develop.</span><br /><span class="internal-link"></span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">JKA is <strong>solidly founded</strong> on the science of Neuroplasticity - the brainâ€™s ability </span><span class="internal-link">to change and reorganize itself by forming new neural connections and </span><span class="internal-link">developmental pathways no matter what the condition is. </span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">The <strong>central focus</strong> is on a therapeutic learning process for helping special </span><span class="internal-link">needs children develop and increase their abilities. It is a neurophysiological </span><span class="internal-link">therapy that helps with the growth and development of the nervous system </span><span class="internal-link">and muscular-skeletal system.</span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">The <strong>goal</strong> is that any child no matter what their developmental challenges are </span><span class="internal-link">can make better use of their potential - physically, mentally and emotionally. </span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">JKA is a <strong>non-invasive</strong> movement based approach which respects every child </span><span class="internal-link">as an intelligent human being. </span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">It is <strong>100% personalized</strong>, not trying to fit the child into a frame, but on the </span><span class="internal-link">contrary, developing a frame that fits each child. </span><span class="internal-link"></span></li>

                    <li><span class="internal-link">It uses a process called <strong>Progressive - Developmental - Abilities - Formation</strong></span></li>
                </ul>
